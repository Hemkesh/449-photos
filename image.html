                “If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not
                sure you can do it, say yes - then learn how to do it later.”

                I am happy to announce that I am going full-time into my startup, UniServices,
                after I graduate from Michigan State University this May with a degree in
                Computer Science. <br><br>

                I got the opportunity to go to TechCrunch Disrupt (in SFO) and CES (in Las
                Vegas) to talk about our startup and network with other people. I got connected
                to amazing mentors and advisors through these events! Thank you for connecting
                with me and helping our startup Ishan Girdhar, Evan Dunbar, Andrew Byrnes,
                Shirish Sharma and all our other advisors and mentors! <br><br>
